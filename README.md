## ðŸ“– About the 20-20-20 Rule

The **20-20-20 rule** is a popular guideline recommended by eye care professionals to combat digital eye strain caused by prolonged screen time. It suggests:

- Look away from your screen every **20 minutes**
- Focus on an object at least **20 feet away**
- Do this for **20 seconds**

This small habit can reduce eye fatigue, dryness, and discomfort during long working or gaming sessions.

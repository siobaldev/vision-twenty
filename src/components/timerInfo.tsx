          What is the 20-20-20 Rule?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
          The 20-20-20 Rule is a guideline designed to reduce eye strain caused
          by prolonged screen time. It suggests that every 20 minutes, you
          should take a 20-second break and look at something 20 feet away. This
          simple practice helps relax the eye muscles and prevent fatigue from
          staring at a screen for extended periods.

          Why is this rule important?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
          This rule is important because prolonged screen time can cause digital
          eye strain, also known as computer vision syndrome. Symptoms can
          include dry eyes, blurred vision, headaches, and neck or back
          discomfort. By following the 20-20-20 Rule, you give your eyes a
          break, reducing the risk of strain and discomfort, and promoting
          better eye health overall.

          How does the 20-20-20 Rule work?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
          The 20-20-20 Rule works by encouraging your eyes to focus on something
          farther away, which helps reduce fatigue. Looking at something close
          up, like a screen, forces your eye muscles to work harder to maintain
          focus. By looking at an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20
          minutes, you give those muscles a chance to relax, thereby reducing
          strain and maintaining eye comfort.
